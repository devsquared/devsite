Welcome to my blog site! 

## Bio

My name is Devin Ward and I am a software developer located in Norman, Oklahoma. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma
with a BS in Math and a minor in Computer Science. Since then, I have worked a few years as a full stack developer on a 
web app. In my free time, I like running, playing video games, and learning new things. My interests in software are machine learning, 
golang, and optimization in code. I love sports especially OU football and Thunder basketball. 

## My Blog's Mission Statement

With this blog, I really just want to have an outlet to share my thoughts. I think that a blog like this allows me to share things in 
a better format than something like Twitter. With that being said, the real mission of this blog is to allow me to explore, learn, and 
experiment while trying to walk through my thinking in a teaching manner. This helps accelerate my learning and adds an extra benefit 
if someone else learns something.

Welcome to my blog site! 

## Bio

My name is Devin Ward and I am a software developer located in Norman, Oklahoma. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma
with a BS in Math and a minor in Computer Science. Since then, I have worked a few years as a full stack developer on a 
web app. In my free time, I like running, playing video games, and learning new things. My interests are machine learning, 
golang, and optimization in code. I love sports especially OU football and Thunder basketball.

Welcome to my blog site! 

## Bio

Well hello there! I am Devin Ward.

**Short Version**: I am a software engineer that really enjoys writing go and rust code. In my free time, you would
catch me running, camping, or hiking. I also really like teaching and learning and general concepts around education. 
I strive to push myself towards growth and am a big thinker. 

**Longer Version**: I grew up in a very rural town in Oklahoma about 10 minutes from Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. There
were about 850 people in my hometown and I graduated with about 30. On the farm I lived on, we raised many animals. I then
went on to get a degree in Math with a minor in CS at University of Oklahoma. 

I got my first job writing software for energy companies to trade assets and evaluate risk. Since then, I have worked for a 
startup in the 3PL (third-party logistics) sector. My free time I use in software is focused on learning about complex
distributed systems. My favorites so far have been implementing a database from scratch and a distributed messaging system.

The other bit of my free time is generally all used up running long distances or lifting weights. I have run 4 marathons now
and I plan to continue to run many more.

If you read the long version, props to you and feel free to reach out to me. 

## My Blog's Mission Statement

This blog acts as some kind of iterative process on my growth and learning in the world of software development along with
a place that I sporadically throw ideas into the ether/forever-saved-interwebs. These things have helped me at some point,
so maybe they can help someone who reads them.

## Socials

My ideas, opinions, and all of those things change. So if you disagree, I would
love to hear from you; help me broaden my horizons.

Welcome to my blog site! 

## Bio

Well hello there! I am Devin Ward. I am a software engineer that really enjoys writing go and rust code. In my free time, you would
catch me running, camping, or hiking. I also really like teaching and learning and general concepts around education. 
I strive to push myself towards growth and am a big thinker. 

## My Blog's Mission Statement

This blog acts as some kind of agile process on my growth and learning in the world of software development along with
a place that I sporadically throw ideas into the ether/forever-saved-interwebs. These things have helped me at some point,
so maybe they can help someone who reads them.

## Socials

My ideas, opinions, and all of those things change. So if you disagree, I would
love to hear from you; help me broaden my horizons.

So 2024 just began and I still feel like it is 2020 somehow. But "new year, new me" and all of those other sayings and 
things. We (being family and I) have made it a year out here in the mountains, and we are quite enjoying it. 2023 was a 
hell of a year. 

Even though it may be clich√©, I quite like setting goals for myself and the new year. I strive to hit the goals, but don't
go out of my way to get them done - if that makes any sense at all. Most of the time, I just look back at my goals towards 
the end of the year to see how I did. So with all that, let's throw some goals out there. 

## running
- 1000 miles
- PR in marathon
- get a good start on mountain trail running
- 100 straight days of running

## lifting
- top 200 in bench press
- top 225 in squats
- be consistent in lifting throughout the year

## other
- be more active on blog 
- put together some series on the blog
- finish garage gym projects

So happy new year and a hearty cheers! May you accomplish all of your goals this year.

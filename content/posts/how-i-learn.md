Learning is a major part of life. We spend at least 13 years of our lives sitting in classrooms focused on nothing but learning 
(at least most do). Continuing to learn has been very important in my life beyond school and college. There has been plenty 
of research on how to best do this. This article will explain how I go about learning and why I think it is effective.

## Feynman Learning Technique

The great physicist [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) knew how to learn. Apparently he learned 
so well that he became on of the world's greatest scientist. He is well known for many things, mostly physics for obvious reasons. 
But also one that is important to everybody, no matter the field of study. This is his learning technique. You may have heard of it, 
but let's define it. 

**The four steps to learning anything:**
1. Choose a concept you wish to learn about
2. Teach it to someone else
3. Identify gaps in your explanation; go back and learn to fill gaps
4. Review, simplify, and repeat

To be entirely fair to the technique, I generalized some of these steps. For instance, in most places step 2 likes to say that you 
should teach to a child or someone of less knowledge. In a lot of the cases that I am going to talk about in this article, much of 
the point is simply to teach and less about who the learner is. 


## The Why

Let's dive into why I feel that this technique is so effective. Feynman's technique allows for you to do some research in something the 
you find interesting, attempt to teach or pass on that new knowledge, and then identify ways for yourself to improve in the area. I find 
this really helpful as mentoring or teaching someone else is a really good way to further your learning. And it also is a really quick 
way to find gaps as the person you are teaching will almost always press your knowledge with questions. To compare it to the world 
of software, this cycle is very similar to the development cycle - gather requirements, build, test, repeat. In software, we test to 
find bugs that we need to fix. In learning, we test our knowledge by teaching in order to find places we can address lack of knowledge. 


## How It Has Helped Me

Throughout my career as a software engineer, I have utilized this technique a lot. 

When I was an intern, I knew that I needed to learn about writing proper unit tests for my code. So I went out and bought a huge, 800+ 
page textbook to read. After many pokes of fun from my lovely wife and many hours of reading, I took that knowledge to work and fixed my 
unit tests that I had. Then, I went and analyzed the test code base at the company. From this, I found some trends that needed some 
fixing. I then asked the leader of our CI/CD team for some input on problems that he has seen. With all of this, I gave a dev talk 
for all of the devs at our company. Here I highlighted what I had learned and some trends that I saw. This was a great experience and 
allowed me to become somewhat of a resource for testing. It also allowed me to realize more gaps that I had in this area. 

This has also helped me recently when looking towards building service-oriented architecture. I went to two really good conferences 
last year where this was a large focus. With that, I started exploring and began trying to teach others. This has allowed me to notice 
the gaps and I have. 

## What's Next

With this, I want to use this blog as a way for me to utilize this technique. As I learn something, I would like to post my learnings. 
This allows me to teach others and notice gaps that I have as I research. Then I can grow that way. So as I put up posts, feel free to 
point out areas I can improve or areas that I have missed. 

With that being said, I intend to do a series on Distributed Systems and the concepts that go with these. Should be a fun one. Thanks 
for reading! Cheers!

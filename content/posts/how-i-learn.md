Learning is a major part of life. We spend at least 13 years of our lives sitting in classrooms focused on nothing but learning 
(at least most do). Continuing to learn has been very important in my life beyond school and college. There has been plenty 
of research on how to best do this. This article will explain how I go about learning and why I think it is effective.

## Feynman Learning Technique

The great physicist [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) knew how to learn. Apparently he learned 
so well that he became one of the world's greatest scientist. He is well known for his contributions to physics. 
But also for something that is important to everybody, no matter the field of study - his learning technique.

**The four steps to learning anything:**
1. Choose a concept you wish to learn about
2. Teach it to someone else
3. Identify gaps in your explanation; go back and learn to fill gaps
4. Review, simplify, and repeat

To be entirely fair to the technique, I generalized some of these steps. For instance, in most places step 2 likes to say that you 
should teach to a child or someone of less knowledge. In a lot of the cases that I am going to talk about in this article, much of 
the point is simply to teach and less about who the learner is. 


## The Why

Let's dive into why I feel that this technique is so effective. Feynman's technique allows for you to do some research in something
that you find interesting, attempt to teach or pass on that new knowledge, and then identify ways for yourself to improve in the area.
I find this really helpful as mentoring or teaching someone else is a really good way to further your learning. And it also is a
really quick way to find gaps as the person you are teaching will almost always press your knowledge with questions. To compare it to
the world of software, this cycle is very similar to the development cycle - gather requirements, build, test, repeat. In software,
we test to find bugs that we need to fix. In learning, we test our knowledge by teaching in order to find places we can address lack
of knowledge. 


## How It Has Helped Me

This has helped me a lot in my day to day. As an intern, I utilized this mainly by explaining to others what I was doing with a
certain task. This cropped up questions that I then was able to turn into knowledge about writing software. As I moved up into 
a junior dev role, I made sure to help others whenever I could about something that I felt confident about. Unit testing was an
area that I had recently read a large book on. So I gave a talk and many people gave me valuable feedback or asked questions
that furthered my learning. As a senior now, one of my favorite parts of the job is helping others or mentoring. This is huge 
in allowing me to find gaps that I have as I try to help.

## What's Next

With this, I want to use this blog as a way for me to utilize this technique. As I learn something, I would like to post my
learnings. This allows me to teach others and notice gaps that I have as I research. Then I can grow that way. So as I put up posts,
feel free to point out areas I can improve or areas that I have missed. After all, you are just helping me learn!

Thanks for reading! Cheers!

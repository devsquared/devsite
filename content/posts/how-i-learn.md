Learning is a major part of life. Most people spend at least 13 years of their lives sitting in classrooms focused on nothing but 
learning. Continuing to learn has been very important in my life beyond school and college. There has been plenty 
of research on how to best do this. This article will explain how I go about learning and why I think it is effective.

## Feynman Learning Technique

The great physicist [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) knew how to learn. One of the greatest 
things that he gave the world has nothing to do with physics though. His learning technique led him to becoming a leading 
scientist. So let's look at how we can take that technique and use it! 

**The four steps to learning anything:**
1. Choose a concept you wish to learn about
2. Teach it to someone else
3. Identify gaps in your explanation; go back and learn to fill gaps
4. Review, simplify, and repeat

*Note that this is my interpretation of the technique. 


## The Why

Let's dive into why I feel that this technique is so effective. Feynman's technique allows for a person to research something
that they find interesting, attempt to teach or pass on that new knowledge, and then identify ways for yourself to improve in the
area. I find that mentoring or teaching someone else is a really good way to further your learning. It also is a
quick way to find gaps as the person being taught will press for knowledge with questions. This cycle is very similar to the
software development cycle - gather requirements, build, test, repeat. A software developer will first need to gather 
requirements so they know what work needs to be done. Then, build a solution that they think will work. Finally, test the 
built solution to find bugs to fix. These three steps are then often repeated until the solution accomplishes the requirements. 
Much like gaps found in knowledge with questions, bugs can be found in software with testing.

## How It Has Helped Me

This process is a helpful tool that I use on a daily basis. As an intern, I explained to others what I was
doing with a certain task. The questions that came after my explanation highlighted blind spots in my knowledge. After
reading a book on unit testing, I gave a talk in front of the company. Many people gave me valuable feedback or asked questions
that furthered my learning. As a senior now, one of my favorite parts of the job is helping others and mentoring. This is essential 
in allowing me to find gaps that I have as I try to help.

## What's Next

I want to use this blog as a way for me to utilize this technique. I would like to post my learnings as I learn something.
This allows me to teach others and notice gaps that I have in my research. As I put up posts, feel free to point out areas I can 
improve or areas I have missed. After all, you are just helping me learn!

Thanks for reading! Cheers!

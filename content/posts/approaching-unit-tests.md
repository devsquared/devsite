- Talk about early me and rough approaches to unit tests and how it was difficult.
  - The wonderful nearly 1000 page long unit test textbook
- Simplifying down to just writing tests and not worrying about perfect tests and 100% coverage
- Where I am now with table testing and getting exactly what I need from tests
  - enables quickly adding
  - makes it easy to establish and show clear scenarios

What do I want the takeaways to be? 
- for early career engineers, we have been there
- stop focusing so much on trying to get 100% test coverage
- perfect testing isn't going to happen
- make sure your stuff is checked and tested as you expect
- code is bound to break; bugs will show up; do your best; but also update your tests with newly found edge cases

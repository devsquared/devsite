Quick note at the top, this is a series post. Series are longer posts with deep dives and generally have many posts in a row.
That's not for everybody. So feel free to come back for the shorter posts.

Recently as I spun around in my spinny chair, I started thinking about how often I use a database and how little I 
really understood about the black box that is the database. For me and - I venture a guess - a lot of software 
engineers, we use databases constantly and really only know that it stores data and eventually learn just a passing
knowledge of SQL. This lead me to dive in and figure this concept out.

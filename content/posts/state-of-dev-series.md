For a long time, I have wanted to write things on the internet. I found joy and value in sharing what I may have just
found, learned, or thought up. Sometimes this results in good conversations with others. Sometimes it just results in
a little touch of happiness for me to see something that I have accomplished. 

In any case, I have always struggled with consistently writing. Most of this is because when I want to write something
up for a blog post, I want to research it well so that it at least seems like I know what I am talking about. This,
unfortunately, leads me to overthinking and then just not posting. Ultimately, I end up feeling like I do not understand
what I want to blog about to the point that I can speak on it with any authority. 

So this has led me to look for a medium that I can share some of my thoughts on things in more of a small conversation-starter-esque
way instead of a full length piece on the matter. Sometimes it may be more of a cocktail party talk where I have some 
time to communicate more. However, I want something that is less than a blog post all the time.

Because of this, I think that a newsletter may be the best for me. That way I can compile smaller things and list them out.
It also allows me to share fun little things that I would enjoy sharing - recipes, books, songs, etc.

So with all of this being said, I am going to start this with a couple of posts in this series here on this blog. If I end
up liking it, I may look into something like Substack or similar for more of a fleshed out newsletter. I will keep this blog
up and continue writing on it when a blog post makes sense.

If you have any thoughts or comments, let me know on Twitter.
